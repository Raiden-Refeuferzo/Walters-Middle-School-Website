        <h1>Welcome To Walters Middle School!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My main priorities are to make sure our students are safe, come to school every day to learn, and be prepared for high school. I feel when students, staff, and community work together we can achieve these priorities, as well as being flexible in California’s changing and advancing education.

            We have many exciting events and programs for everyone to participate. I want to encourage all parents and guardians to be involved in their child’s education. Students will be more prepared and successful when parents are involved. There are many committees for parents/guardians to participate in (PTSA, SSC, ELAC, DELAC, and Volunteering in a variety of ways). Information for all of these committees will be provided in this newsletter, during MAZE day,and the Walters’s website.

            I am eager to start another productive year as we move forward with full implementation of Common Core Standards and striving to achieve student readiness for college and career. Our staff is dedicated to educate and inspire. Working together as a team we will increase our ability to succeed as we increase our standards and meaningful assessments. We, as Walters’s community, are here to help students achieve their goals. I look forward to another great year at Walters Middle School.</p>
